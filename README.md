# Pokemon_API_usage_HTML_Javascript_CSS

# Description
The purpose of this repository is to showcase using an API endpoint to create an HTML webpage with a CSS stylesheet that will be deployed automatically using Github Actions CI/CD tool. In this particular repository, javascript is also used to parse the data from PokeAPI and populate desired fields into the HTML document to be displayed on webpage.

# Requirements to run HTML document 
The repo contents can be run on any operating system without issue. The only requirement is a browser/browser-version that supports CSS grid functionality.

# Installation Instructions
The contents of this repository are ready to be deployed. All contents should be downloaded to one folder and the HTML file run directly in your browser.

This repository will automatically deploy upon a push to the respository, which will run Super-Linter, which will check automatically for any build errors or formatting errors in each document.

WARNING: Super-Linter is very specific on formatting and will give a large variety of errors if formatting is not clean. Recommended to push small changes at a time to the repository and check results of Super-Linter under GitHub Actions tab.
